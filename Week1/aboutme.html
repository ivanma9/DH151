			Hi, my name is <strong>Ivan Ma</strong>. I really like everything about
			<strong>soccer</strong>. I like to try new
			<em><strong>foods</strong></em> and explore different food spots. Some of
			my goals for this course is to build a useful website alongside other
			majors in an <em>interdisciplinary</em> fashion. I hope to jump in to
			learn how to use the web maps well. It seems like a great feature to put
			in an application, and I want to be able to do it <em>creatively</em> and
			<em>user-friendly</em>. I hope to learn from experience and from the
			professor and my peers.
		</p>

			I hope to make application similar to Yelp.
