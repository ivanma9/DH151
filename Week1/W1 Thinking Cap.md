Link to the site

THe site's agenda is to provide information to the community of wildfire activity.

This site speaks to me because it is very informative for nearby fires going on whether it be planning to travel or caution to evacuate a city depending on the severity of a wildfire.

When you click the fire icon on the map, it gives you information about the type of fire, how many acres burned, cause of fire, status of the fire being contained, and updates of the fire within that location. I think it gives very informative information for quick details about the fire. I even think there could be less on the information when I hover on the pin.

The map is powered by esri. https://www.esri.com/en-us/home

If I could change something about it, I would reduce the amount of information in the modal and utilize more icons for frequent information that can replaced with a legend or informative icons.
